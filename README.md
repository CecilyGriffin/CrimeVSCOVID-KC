# ETL-Project

We set out to show the relationship between COVID data and Crime Rates in the Kansas City area to show the zip codes that are most impacted by the two crisis. It was important to us to focus on something local and relevant to our lives right now. Kansas City is facing both a health crisis with COVID-19 and a violence crisis as we're seeing the White House begin "Operation: Legend" to help with violence in our community. 

We found our original datasets on OpenDataKC. They are both the most current datasets, only showing information from 2020. Once we pulled the data, we cleaned it using Python Pandas, and then loaded the datasets into PgAdmin using SQL.
